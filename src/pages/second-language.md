After two years of web development with JavaScript it was time to learn a second language. With the myriad of modern languages to choose from I set to the internet to inform my decision.

### The Big Deal
I see people on social media flash a list of 7 programming languages they're fluent in (and most job listings prefer you to know at least three), so maybe learning a "second" language is about as monumental as graduating the fourth grade. At the time for me it was a little bigger than that though.
